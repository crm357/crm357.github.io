#### Issue 1


From the project instructions:

"_It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders:)_"  


As I've learned through my years in development, to get at the correct answer one must go down the rabbit hole. That rabbit hole is _stackover.com_.  Neither the course instructions nor even ChatGPT knew how to get an .html file to render at GitHub.  Stackoverflow went straight to the correct answer:

"_The most comfortable way to preview HTML files on GitHub is to go to https://htmlpreview.github.io/ or just prepend it to the original URL, i.e.: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/blob/master/index.html_".  




#### Issue 2

As I note in my project report, the Johns Hopkins data science course material is showing its age and methods that may have worked when the course was developed may no longer work. Things change over time.  I ask the faculty to go through the entire Data Science certification material and bring it into sync with the latest technologies.  

Certain editorial license had to be taken in this project as the train and test .csv files are not compatible. It is unknown whether this was a deliberate choice to gauge a student's adaptibility in exploring the data or that the original source of the data made changes to the test.csv since the Hopkins Data Science course material was developed.  Things change over time.

You will see where I address this in my report.
